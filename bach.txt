When Irun a command jobrunhist -j zqscalar_rel_sum_ga in unix and here job is being fetched from excel sheet  job.xlsx with Job Names as column and then we have these values in 
this column
I get below text

Job: zqscalar_rel_sum_ga

Start time        End time          Duration   Status      Exit   Machine                     Run Num    NTry

what you need to do is first create a table  in MSSQL with columns job name, start time, end time, duration, status, exit, machine, run num, ntry
so give me a SQL for that based on your understanding of column names, data type and constraint.

once table is created, I am running jobrunhist -j zqscalar_rel_sum_ga in unix and you need to fetch values from these commands
Job: zqscalar_rel_sum_ga

Start time        End time          Duration   Status      Exit   Machine                     Run Num    NTry

and prepare insert queries to insert these values in table. I need you to print these insert queries also and make sure that it generates insert queries 
up to the start time value. I mean it has to exclude all these kind of rows which don't have start time value like Average time run based on failed
Average time run based on passed
o anything so basically upto time.
