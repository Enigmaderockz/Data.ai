Idea Pitch
Imagine a ChatGPT that doesn’t just answer your questions but actively runs utilities for you on command—fetching tools, executing scripts, and delivering results without needing technical setup or complex commands. Introducing PromptExec AI: an AI-powered operational assistant that connects to a centralized code repository, interprets your prompt, selects the right utility, executes it, and gives you instant feedback.


Problem Statement
Modern development and IT operations involve countless scripts, utilities, and tools stored across networks or Git repositories. Accessing and executing these tools can be slow and error-prone. Developers spend significant time searching for utilities, setting up environments, and executing scripts correctly. Moreover, team members with less technical expertise struggle to benefit from these resources, which slows down workflow and creates bottlenecks.

Complexity: Even simple tasks often involve multiple steps to locate, configure, and run utilities.
Time Consumption: Manually finding and executing utilities wastes valuable time, especially for developers, DevOps engineers, and QA teams.
Access Gap: Non-technical users or new team members miss out on automation benefits due to complexity, limiting efficiency.

Solution
With PromptExec AI, users simply type what they need in natural language. The assistant will:

Interpret the Request: Understand the user's intent and identify the required utility.
Fetch & Configure the Script: Locate the script from a central repository (NAS or Git), set the required parameters, and handle setup.
Execute & Return Results: Run the script or utility, returning results to the user in an easy-to-digest format without any manual steps.

Imagine saying, "Run the test coverage report," and instantly getting detailed metrics, or "Fetch the latest system health report," and receiving an automated analysis—all without leaving the chat interface.

What It Takes to Make This Idea a Reality
